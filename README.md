# RisiKo-probabilities-calculator

## Description

This is a CLI probabilities calculator for the game RISIKO. Given the battle info, i.e. attaccker and defender armies size, it will compute the **probability of winning the battle** and more statistics about the battle.

The project is based on [*Markov Chains for the RISK Board Game Revisited*](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~jaosborn/research/RISK.pdf).
